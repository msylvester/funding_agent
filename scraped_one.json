If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven bythree advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that producedmore power ",
